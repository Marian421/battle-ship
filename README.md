# Battle ship

## Description

This project is a JavaScript implementation of the classic Battleship game. It models core game logicâ€”like ships, boards, and player turns - entirely in JavaScript, separating all DOM interactions from game functionality. This separation makes the codebase more maintainable and easier to test.

Although DOM manipulation is used for the user interface, the main logic is built as isolated modules, ensuring clean architecture and testability. Players take turns attacking each other's gameboards until all of one player's ships are sunk.
